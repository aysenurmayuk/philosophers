# Philosophers

## üìñ Introduction  
The **Philosophers** project is part of the 42 curriculum and is based on the famous "Dining Philosophers Problem" created by Edsger Dijkstra. It explores the concepts of concurrency, synchronization, and resource management by simulating philosophers who share limited resources.

## üéØ Purpose  
This project aims to:  
- Introduce the basics of multithreading or multiprocessing.  
- Demonstrate the challenges of resource sharing and synchronization.  
- Teach debugging techniques for race conditions and deadlocks.  

By solving this problem, you‚Äôll enhance your understanding of parallel programming and system-level resource management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features  
- **Concurrency**: Philosophers act independently as threads or processes.  
- **Resource Management**: Proper use of mutexes or semaphores to handle forks and prevent conflicts.  
- **Simulation**: Implements philosophers' behaviors (eating, thinking, and sleeping) while adhering to project constraints.  
- **Error Handling**: Validates input and gracefully manages edge cases like insufficient resources.
